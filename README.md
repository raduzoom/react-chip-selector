<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Component


**Chip selector** is a universal tool that helps you display a chip selector to your project. The chip selector has an input where you can filter out results. You can place it anywhere via simple markup:

   ```javascript
<ReactChipSelector suggestedOptions={chipSelectorItems} chipSelectorOptions={(chipSelectorOptions)}
 onSelectedOptionsChange={handleSelectedOptionsChange}></ReactChipSelector>
   ```
